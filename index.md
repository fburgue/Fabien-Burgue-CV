## Profile

Since the beginning of studies at university I’m a new technology enthusiatic and a great fan of people who want to push forward High Tech. 
At start there were hardware and after that virtualization came with so much stuff to play. 

Structured and creative, I always want to improve myself to enjoy each day at work.

Entertainer and Assertive I prefer to give ideas in fun instead of a too tight discipline. Fun is Creative and Creativity leads to Improvement…
